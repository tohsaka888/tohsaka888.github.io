## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### Key Advantages

1.  **Rapid Prototyping**: Build custom designs without writing custom CSS.
2.  **Maintainability**: Utility classes are easy to understand and maintain.
3.  **Performance**: Tailwind automatically removes unused CSS, resulting in smaller bundle sizes.

It's a powerful tool for developers looking for speed and flexibility.
