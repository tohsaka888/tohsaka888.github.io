## Reusable and Beautiful Components

shadcn-ui isn't a component library in the traditional sense. Instead, you copy and paste component code directly into your project, giving you full control.

### Why Choose It?

- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt components to your project's theme.
- **Not a Dependency**: You own the code, so no black boxes.

Integrating shadcn-ui can significantly speed up your development workflow while ensuring high-quality UI.
